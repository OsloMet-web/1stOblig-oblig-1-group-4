                <h3>Our solution for office space booking</h3>
                <p>Office spaces which have made the leap from the antiquated office layout consisting of designated work desks,<br>to the more modern paradigm of open solution encounter a new problem.<br>Which is how to ensure every worker gets a suitable place to work.<br>Since you might be forced to accept a desk space in a noise meeting room,<br>when you would much rather work alone in quiet.<br><br>Our solution is the Prismspace booking system</p></p>

                <h3>Prismspace</h3>
                <p>The Prismspace booking system primarily uses a colour coded list of days,<br>with a secondary coloured LED light embedded behind the lamp fixations.<br>Our concept may not be the most intuitive,<br>nevertheless it should make getting familiar with the system fun.</p>
